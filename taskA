To comment out the auth and the files sections since the repos for them are private and remove them from nginx configuration to prevent errors
Once I was able to run the microservices,i was able to access the Apollo GraphQL interface at (http://localhost/graphql)
I hard coded a dummy user to bypass authentication while creating clubs in all the otypes.py files
I removed the check for a valid uid in the case of adding members to the club as there was no mutation to create a user in the schema
